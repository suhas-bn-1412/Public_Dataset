"Consider N threads that want to each execute their first operation before any thread proceeds to the second operation. Below is the code that each thread runs in order to achieve this synchronization. count is an integer shared variable initialized to zero and mutex is a mutex binary semaphore, initialized to one, that protects this shared variable. You are told that this code is wrong and does not work correctly. Suggest the changes to be made to the code in the snippet below to fix it by using only semaphores and no other synchronization mechanism.",4,4
